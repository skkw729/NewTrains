# NewTrains
Program code for group project at Newcastle University.

The program reads data about train stations, travel time between stations and trainline information from .csv files

The program can offer the shortest path with respect to Dijkstra's time-dependent algorithm in order to take the route with the earliest arrival time.

This program is to be implemented through a servlet and executed by interacting with a website.
